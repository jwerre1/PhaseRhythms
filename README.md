# PhaseRhythms

### Console app to check rhythms for phase shift redundancies and create a performable score.

The musical piece "Clapping Music" by Steve Reich features two performers, each clapping a repeated rhythm (12 eighth notes in length). At the beginning, both perform the same rhythm, but after 12 repetitions, one performer skips one eighth note, causing the two to be shifted out of sync (a so called "Phase Shift"). The occures 12 times until the two return to clapping in unison.

This application allows users to create their own rhythm, check that it will not create a redunandency where two phase shifts produce the same rhythm, then create a performable score.
